I am a Lecturer in the University of Sheffield, Information School. My primary research interest is Big Data Analytics and Crowdsourcing. I conduct inter-disciplinary research on highly engaging, interactive and visual mechanisms in conjunction with complex querying techniques for seamless navigation, exploration and understanding of complex datasets.

My research involves studying and developing data and visual analytic techniques to analyse massive volumes of dynamic data in near real time. I have applied my research in a wide range of application domains such as Aerospace Engineering, Sports Informatics, Crisis/Emergency Management, Smart Cities and Mobility Planning. As a part of my research, I collaborate with large multi-disciplinary teams of academics, industry partners, city councils and planners.
